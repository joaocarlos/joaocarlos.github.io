## Abstract

Robotics is a growing field of study, proposing automated solutions for various os humanity daily tasks. With the advent of mobile robotics, robotic platforms began to perform dynamic movements in order to have autonomy in execution of tasks. Computer vision applications have provided robotic platforms with navigation and mapping capabilities through image processing. This paper presents a distance measurement system, based on the detection of a line laser, using image processing techniques to determine the distance to multiple obstacles and analyze the system performance. The measurement range used during the tests ranged from 20 cm to 100 cm, with an average error of 0.68 cm and response time approximately 153 ms. The system was implemented on the Raspberry Pi, model B+ computer platform, where the processing capacity was combined with the low implementation cost. The results emphasize the accuracy of the analyzed methods, with error rates of up to 1.36 % and high performance when applied to computational platforms with low processing power.
