## Abstract

Abstract The rapid urbanization process has presented complex challenges that require innovative strategies to enhance urban living and promote sustainable growth. In this context, the concept of smart cities has quickly evolved, illustrating urban environments that utilize advanced technology to achieve greater efficiency, sustainability, and an improved quality of life for residents. The development of these smart environments relies on technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), which collects extensive data through sensors, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), for advanced data processing and decision-making. For the latter, while traditional AI solutions have improved urban systems in multiple ways, emerging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models signify a new era for smart cities, offering breakthroughs in urban design, simulation, and personalized, context-aware solutions. This article explores the applications, impacts, challenges, and promising future trends of GenAI within the context of smart cities, discussing generative urban intelligence perspectives for simulating alternative urban scenarios, co-designing infrastructure prototypes, and improving service delivery. It provides a pioneering perspective on an underexplored field that is expected to transform urban design, planning, and management.
