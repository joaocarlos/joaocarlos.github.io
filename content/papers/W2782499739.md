## Abstract

Camera-enabled sensors deployed for visual monitoring will cover a region of the target field, providing information for many innovative applications based on wireless sensing. Actually, some areas of the monitored field may have more relevance than others, according to the characteristics of the applications, which may indicate that such areas need better coverage to avoid blind spots and achieve higher visual redundancy. In order to provide a metric to assess how well relevant areas are being covered, this paper proposes an availability metric which associates coverage to the relevance of areas, which may be useful when assessing monitoring availability. Moreover, a greedy algorithm is also proposed to compute sensing orientations for all visual sensors, aiming at the enhancement of visual coverage over the most relevant areas. With such proposals, it is possible to initially address the particular problem of visual coverage over areas with different relevances, providing practical mechanisms to improve the overall availability level of monitoring applications in wireless visual sensor networks.
