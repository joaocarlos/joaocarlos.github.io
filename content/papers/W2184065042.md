## Abstract

This paper presents two architectures for the Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) encoder, the first one based on a fully serial approach and the second one in a mixed way, as well as their respective realizations in ASIC. The proposed designs are capable of operating in 84 combinations of code rate and word size, according to the IEEE 802.22 Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN) standard, aiming low power and small area. Although the proposed architectures are primarily designed for the mentioned standard, they can be easily adapted to other wireless broadband standards.
