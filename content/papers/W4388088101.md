## Abstract

The interoperability of multiple sensors is a crucial feature for emergency management in smart cities because they allow more comprehensive perceptions of critical situations by Emergency Detection Units (EDUs). The flexibility of multi-sensor units may also ensure that a system is tailored to fit different environments and situations. Since smart cities are inherently prone to emergencies, which may happen anywhere and in an unpredictable way, this paper proposes a development architecture that enables interoperability and dynamic configuration of sensors attached to an EDU. Such an architecture is proposed to allow dynamic insertion and removal of physical sensors, which incorporate some metadata to allow any EDU to dynamically adapt to new physical configurations. By combining a plug-and-play feature enabled by the use of custom Transducer Data Sheets (TEDS) inspired by the IEEE 1451 standard, the proposed architecture expects to reduce configuration and deployment times while reducing development costs, potentially improving emergency management systems in smart cities.
