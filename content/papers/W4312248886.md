## Abstract

Technological advances have proved to be a great tool for education, its applications allow a range of innovations in the teaching-learning process.When applied correctly, it is possible to attract the attention and curiosity of young people.In view of this, the ITUBERAbots project seeks dynamic and thought-provoking measures so that students feel challenged and induced to observe, abstract and invent, joining theory to practice.For this, we opted for a methodology divided into two modules: module I -Simulated Robot Soccer, where the basic concepts of logic and programming were applied; module II -SL Line Follower Robot, in which the basic concepts of circuits and electronic components and the assembly of the SL Robot were applied.Finally, the participants applied the knowledge acquired in the course in scientific competitions.
