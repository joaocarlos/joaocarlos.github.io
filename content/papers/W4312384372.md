## Abstract

Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are areas of knowledge that foster student interest due to numerous applications, such as robot football, medicine and industry.In this sense, the project aims to stimulate interest in exact sciences and engineering, through studies in programming, AI and robotics.For this was adopted a methodology divided into stages: material didactic development, dissemination, selection of students, remote classes, evaluation of students through challenges related to the three areas of knowledge.In addition, -the week of -the UFRB Robot Football Team (UFRBots Week) was also organized.The analyzed results showed a high level of satisfaction among students who stayed throughout the course.In this way, this project disseminated through information to the community the importance of these technological issues addressed to society.
