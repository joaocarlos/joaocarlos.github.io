## Abstract

The smart-city revolution has been promoted as the next step in urban development, leveraging technology to achieve enhanced development standards amid the increasingly complex challenges of urbanization. However, despite the implementation of more efficient urban services, issues regarding their tangible effects and impact on people’s lives remain unresolved. In this context, the concept of intelligent cities is seen as a necessary evolution of the smart-city paradigm, positioning human factors as the driving forces behind urban technological evolution. This integrative concept embodies advanced technology to enhance essential urban functions, with sustainability, equity, and resilience as macro-development goals. This study reviews the multifaceted dimensions of intelligent cities, from designing and deploying smart infrastructure to implementing citizen-centric decision-making processes. Additionally, it critically examines the digital divide and highlights the importance of equitable development policies as essential for enabling transformative urban change. By linking technological advancement to social issues, this article provides practical insights and case studies from the cities of Helsinki, Barcelona, and Buenos Aires, demonstrating that smart-city initiatives are still failing to bridge the equity service distribution gap. This comprehensive assessment approach ultimately serves as a reference for future evaluations of intelligent urban transformations.
