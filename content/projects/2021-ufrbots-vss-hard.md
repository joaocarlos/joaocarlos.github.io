## Project Overview

This project aims to stimulate students' interest in exact and technological sciences through the study of robot soccer. To this end, we propose the development of a robot prototype for the IEEE Very Small Size category, which will serve as a base platform for the construction of new robots and for the development of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and control systems strategies.

## Objectives

1. Promote lectures/training workshops on computer programming and 3D modeling.
2. Design a functional robot prototype for the VSS category.
3. Develop the necessary software interface mechanisms to control the robot's locomotion, as well as the remote control interface.
4. Promote interest in extension projects among BCET and Engineering students.
5. Combine extension, research, and robotics teaching activities.

## Activities

-   Workshop of Very Small Size category of RoboCup Soccer Simulation

## Impact

-   This project involved around 50 students from various high schools in the Recôncavo da Bahia region, promoting STEM education and interest in robotics through simulated robot soccer activities.
