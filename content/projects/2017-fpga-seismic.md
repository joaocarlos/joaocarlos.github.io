## Project Overview

The development of this research aimed to deliver a prototype of an FPGA architecture, optimized and applied to the 2D Reverse Time Migration (RTM) workflow. Hardware implementation aspects were correlated with RTM computation optimizations present in the literature.

## Objectives

1. Develop FPGA-based acceleration platform for RTM
2. Optimize RTM algorithm for hardware implementation
3. Integrate with HPC environment
4. Validate prototype performance

## Results

1. [Performance and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Reverse Time Migration on a FPGA Platform](http://joaocarlos.github.io/papers/performance-and-energy-efficiency-analysis-of-reverse-time-migration-on-a-fpga-platform/)
2. [Imageamento Sísmico com FPGA Aplicado a Migração Reversa no Tempo](http://joaocarlos.github.io/papers/imageamento-sísmico-com-fpga-aplicado-a-migração-reversa-no-tempo/)
