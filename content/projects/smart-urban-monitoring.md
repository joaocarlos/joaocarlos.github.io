## Project Overview

This research project focuses on developing advanced IoT infrastructure for urban environmental monitoring systems. The platform integrates multiple sensor networks across metropolitan areas to collect, process, and analyze environmental data in real-time.

## Objectives

1. Design and implement a scalable MQTT-based communication architecture
2. Develop adaptive priority scheduling algorithms for heterogeneous sensor data
3. Create data fusion mechanisms for multi-modal environmental sensing
4. Deploy pilot systems in partner cities for validation

## Methodology

The project employs a multi-phase approach combining theoretical research with practical deployment:

-   **Phase 1**: Infrastructure design and protocol development
-   **Phase 2**: Algorithm implementation and simulation testing
-   **Phase 3**: Pilot deployment and field validation
-   **Phase 4**: Performance optimization and scalability testing

## Expected Outcomes

-   Open-source platform for urban IoT monitoring
-   Publications in high-impact venues
-   Technology transfer to municipal partners
-   Training of graduate researchers
