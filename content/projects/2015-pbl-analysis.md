## Project Overview

This research project aims to analyze the positive and negative aspects of Problem-Based Learning (PBL), the impact of such methodology over the students' soft skills and in the pedagogical practice of the professors, through quantitative and qualitative evaluation mechanisms.

## Objectives

1. Analyze PBL implementation in Computer Engineering
2. Evaluate impact on student competencies
3. Assess pedagogical practices of professors
4. Provide recommendations for improvement

## Methodology

-   Quantitative evaluation mechanisms
-   Qualitative assessment tools
-   Student and professor surveys
-   Competency analysis

## Results

-   Several internal reports and presentations to UEFS academic community
-   Contribution to the improvement of PBL practices at UEFS
-   Enhanced understanding of PBL impact on engineering education
