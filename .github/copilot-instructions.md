# Instructions for Copilot

When generating code or documentation related to the Hugo project, please ensure that you:

1. **Use Markdown Format**: All content should be in Markdown format, as Hugo supports this natively.
2. **Follow Hugo's Content Structure**: Use the appropriate front matter for pages, including `title`, `date`, and `description`.
3. **Maintain Consistent Style**: Follow the existing style and structure of the Hugo project, including headings, lists, and links.
4. **Use Hugo Shortcodes**: Utilize Hugo shortcodes for features like images, videos, and other media to ensure compatibility.
5. **Test Locally**: Always test your changes locally before committing to ensure they render correctly in the Hugo environment.
6. **Refer to Hugo Documentation**: For any specific features or functionalities, refer to the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) to ensure best practices are followed.
7. **Use Variables and Partials**: Leverage Hugo's templating features, such as variables and partials, to keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
8. **Keep Accessibility in Mind**: Ensure that any generated content is accessible, including using alt text for images and proper heading structures.
9. **Use Semantic HTML**: When writing HTML within Markdown, use semantic elements to enhance SEO and accessibility.
10. **Comment Your Code**: Add comments in your code to explain complex logic or important sections, making it easier for others to understand.
11. **Do not create Markdown files with modifications**: Avoid consolidate the conversation into a Markdown file.
12. **Wait the system to be complete to generate Markdown documentation**: Only generate Markdown documentation after the system is fully implemented and tested.
